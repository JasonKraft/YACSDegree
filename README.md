 ##Preliminary Process of Creating a Degree

 1. Enter a name and short-hand
 2. Select a department
 3. Select a semester (defaults to current semester)
 4. Enter degree rules GUI
 5. Create a new rule. This rule can be:
 	- required course + alternative
 	- science electives*
 	- HASS electives*
 	- free electives*
	- depth/breadth requirement (what does this even mean?)
 6. Rinse. Repeat. Profit (for each new rule).
 7. Display number of required credits.
 8. Save and/or publish degree

*Electives can differ for each degree.
